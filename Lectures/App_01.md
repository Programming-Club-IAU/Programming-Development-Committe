## üß† Assignment:

Solve these 2 tasks using Dart.

**Task 1: simple calculator**

1-	Ask the user to:

  - Enter the first number.

<br>

If the answer is n, exit the loop and print "Calculator closed".

**Task 2: Vehicle Inheritance**

<br>

1.	Create a class called Vehicle with:

  -	Properties: brand, year.
  
  -	A constructor to initialize them.
  
  -	A method displayInfo() to print vehicle info.

<br>
  
2.	Create a subclass called Car that inherits from Vehicle.

  -	Add an extra property: model.
  
  -	Override the displayInfo() method to include model.

3.	In the main() function:

  -	Create at least two Car objects with different data.
  
    -	Call the displayInfo() method for each object.
