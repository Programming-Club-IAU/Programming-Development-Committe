## 🏆 Tie-Break Rule

If two people have the same **total points (main + bonus)**,  
the one with the **higher main points** will be ranked higher.  

**Example:**  

- Person A: 100 main + 100 bonus = 200 total  
- Person B: 140 main + 60 bonus = 200 total  
👉 Person **B** is ranked higher because they have more **main points**.

Some weeks will have **double points**,  
which will be announced later, insha’Allah.
